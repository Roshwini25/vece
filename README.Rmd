## {vece} - Vaccine Extension Cost Evaluation

This is a working R compendium (think R package but for reproducible analysis). A good overview on research compendiums, see the [R for Reproducible Research](https://annakrystalli.me/rrresearch/index.html) course.

This repository collects, cleans and collates spatialtemporal covariates for antimalarial resistance modelling.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/OJWatson/vece.git
cd vece
open vece.Rproj
```

`devtools::install_dev_deps()` will install all required packages, as specified in the Imports in DESCRIPTION. (At a later date when analysis is finalised, `renv` can be used to create a reproducible R environment that anyone can use by calling `renv::restore` to set up package dependencies.) 

### Overview

The structure within analysis is as follows:

```
R/                            # Packaged R functions 

analysis/
    |
    ├── 01_xxxxx /            # analysis scripts used for generating figures
    |
    ├── plots/                # location of figures produced by the analysis scripts
    |
    ├── tables/               # location of any tables produced by the analysis scripts
    |
    ├── data_raw/             # data obtained from elsewhere and treated read-only    
    |
    ├── data_derived/         # intermediate data generated during the analysis

```

* Analysis scripts are to be run in the numbered order they are included. If there are
shared numbers, then any order of these scripts works. 

* Data that is **read only**, e.g. data shared from elsewhere and not generated using 
code in this repository, is stored in `data_raw`

* Data that is generated using code in this repository is stored in `data_derived`.

* Outputs from the analysis scripts, such as plots and tables are stored in `plots` 
and `tables` respectively.

### Compendium DOI (to add when we want to publish our work): 
 
https://zenodo.org/record/XXX

The files at the URL above will generate the results as found in the publication.

### The R package 

This repository is organized as an R package. There are only a few R functions exported in this package - the majority of the R code is in the analysis directory. The R package structure is here to help manage dependencies, to take advantage of continuous integration, and so we can keep file and data management simple. For any R packages that are used frequently in this repository, they are documented in `R/` and are used in the analysis folder using `devtools::load_all()`. 

To download the package source as you see it on GitHub, for offline browsing, use this line at the shell prompt (assuming you have Git installed on your computer):

```{r eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/OJWatson/vece.git
```

Once the download is complete, open the `vece.Rproj` in RStudio to begin working with the package and compendium files. We will endeavour to keep all package dependencies required listed in the DESCRIPTION. 

<!-- To add this once all the analysis is done -->
<!-- In addition, once analysis is completed, we will use `renv` to track package dependencies for reproducibility. Please use `renv::restore` to restore the state of the project and see https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html for more information. -->
